LDA to perform topic modelling, to find out topics being discussed on twitter by different age groups

The data was obtained from an online server in json format.
This was imported and stored in MongoDB for easier access.
The twitter users age was first calculated, since I wanted to identify trends in each age group
Used LDA to perform topic modelling on the twitter data.
